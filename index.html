            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Like i earlier said, my name is Newson Goodnews. I hail from Rivers State Nigeria. I come from a family
                of 5.
                I got into the university to study pharmacy but i ended up studying Forestry and wildlife management. I loved the
                course at the end as it has to do with preserving the natures eco system. However, I am trying to start
                a carrer in tech as a backend engineer and can't wait to actualize my dream and actually land a job. As
                this will help me build my finances and i will be able to take care of my loved ones.</p>
